              <h1>About Café Galleria</h1>
              <p>
                Café Galleria is located in San Francisco, California and was
                founded with an idea to create a space that would not only serve
                great coffee but be an environment where friends and famiy can
                enjoy a third place as their home. With delicious coffee, great
                company, and food, what else could be even better? We'd love for
                you to come join us and unwind.

              <h1>Our Coffee</h1>
              <p>
                Our espresso beans are sourced from Vietnam which is typically
                known for growing arabica coffee. We partnered with a family
                farm who also have passion for coffee. With our visions
                combined, we created Café Galleria to share this fresh and
                bright espresso beans to thousans of visitors like you.
